# Psyche Coordinator - Breaking Changes

## Abstract

Once a Solana account is initialized and stores a data structure, its binary layout becomes locked in, meaning any update to the smart contract account's data layout must either:

- Preserve ABI compatibility
- Perform explicit migrations

In practice, it means that any update to the Coordinator's data structure needs to abide by this constraints.

Anchor derives layout using `#[account]` and `AnchorSerialize`/`AnchorDeserialize`. It's critical not to change enum variants, reorder fields, or change types without bumping version fields and writing explicit migrations.

This is because if the program's logic is being upgraded but the on-chain account still retains the old memory layout that was relied upon before the smart contract was upgraded, the new smart contract version will fail to read the old account's state properly, leading to runtime errors and vulnerabilities.

## Mitigations

There are a few types of potential avenues to mitigate the problem, each can be applied in different situations

### 1) Architectural changes

A few code logic changes can help make future breaking changes more forgiving.

#### A) Use PDAs for modular storage

Due to the nature of serialization/deserialization where all information is stored sequentially in a byte array: the bigger the datastructure is, the more likely it is to introduce a breaking change.

It then makes a lot of sense to split the program's state into multiple PDAs to avoid a large monolithic state, this also would allow for easier migrations of smaller PDAs. Different PDAs could use different mitigation strategies independently, depending on the specific situation. This would also help upgrade and migrate individual chunks of data atomically and independently. It also helps with avoiding the 10KB max size limit per account.

#### B) Add data-structure versioning

Adding a versioning system to the data structures enables conditional migration logic. This can be done through either:

- an `Enum` of which each case is a version (most powerful, but complex)
- a `version` field on the data structure (most simple, but has limitations)

Note: Also don't forget to use `#[repr(C)]` to ensure the predictability of the memory layout as by default the `#[repr(Rust)]` has undefined behaviour and its memory layout is left to the responsibility of the compiler's optimizer implementation (relevant for bytemuck serialized accounts).

### 2) Backward compatible changes

In some cases, it is possible to make changes to the memory layout without requiring any migrations but it requires careful editing and planning.

```rust
// Before
#[account]
// Be careful about non-packed data structures, as there will be invisible padding added by the compiler between fields
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct MyAccountV1 {
    pub my_field1: u64,
    pub _reserved: [u8, 256], // Zeroed out memory for future use
}
// After
#[account]
#[repr(C, packed)]
pub struct MyAccountV2 {
    pub my_field1: u64,
    pub my_field2: u32, // my_field2 is zeroed by default
    pub _reserved: [u8, 252], // Adjusted size, 4 bytes now used by my_field2
}
```

In those special cases, we can achieve changes that require no migrations.

### 3) Explicit Migrations

In many cases it is not possible to do backward compatible changes. We then have to migrate the content of the accounts to convert between account layout versions.

#### 1) Trustless On-chain Migrations

Running on-chain migrations entails creating a new instruction on the smart contract to update the content of an account. Typically it can be summarized as the following:

```rust
// Pseudo-code (Smart contract instruction implementation)
pub fn migrate_my_account(ctx: Context<MigrateMyAccount>) -> Result<()> {
    // No need to verify the signers, as there's no input, anyone can run this instruction
    let my_account = &mut ctx.accounts.my_account;
    if !is_v1(my_account.data) {
        return Err(ProgramError::AccountIsNotTheRightVersion);
    }
    let info_v1 = InfoV1::deserialize(&my_account.data)?;
    let info_v2 = InfoV2::from_v1(info_v1);
    info_v2.serialize(&my_account.data)
}
```

Note: the program must also check that the account has been migrated before trying to read its content inside of other instructions.

#### 2) Trust-Based Centralized Migrations

If all else fails, an account can also be migrated by a trusted authority by pushing arbitrary data to the on-chain account using a specialized instruction in the smart contract. It can be summarized with the following implementation:

```rust
// Pseudo-code (Smart contract instruction implementation)
pub fn force_upload(ctx: Context<ForceUpload>) -> Result<()> {
    if ctx.accounts.signer != SUPER_AUTHORITY {
        return Err(ProgramError::UnauthorizedUpload);
    }
    let account = ctx.accounts.target;
    account.data[ctx.args.offset..] = ctx.args.bytes;
    Ok(())
}
```

Then this script can be run by the authority's keypair owner:

```typescript
// Pseudo-code (Local script)
async function migrateMyAccount(address: Pubkey) {
	let infoV1 = await fetchMyAccount(address)
	let infoV2 = convertToV2(infoV1)
	let dataV2 = infoV2.serialize()
	await forceUploadDataTo(address, dataV2) // force-push (upload) signed by program upgrade authority
}
```

Note: while this is possible, this requires the authority to sign-off on every single account's migration. This effectively makes the system centralized and trust-based, which should be avoided if possible.
